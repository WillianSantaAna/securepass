                <p>
                    <strong>Private Cloud</strong> is a proprietary computational structure model dedicated to a single
                    company. Like other types of cloud computing structures, the private cloud offers virtualized and
                    extended computing resources through physical components stored on-site or in a third-party vendor's
                    datacenters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of its main advantages of a private cloud structure is the level of control offered to the
                    company. As the private cloud is accessible only to a single entity, that organization has the
                    ability to program its environment and manage it in a way that exclusively meets the company's
                    computing needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A private cloud strategy can consist of hardware hosted locally in a facility owned by the company
                    itself or it can also be hosted by a cloud service provider, which in this case would be dedicated
                    servers. Virtual private clouds are normally paid for continuously, but the hardware and storage
                    configurations guarantee a secure, exclusive and more affordable structure.

                    <h3>What are the advantages of the Private Cloud?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The best benefits that companies can gain from structuring their IT systems in a <strong>Private
                            Cloud</strong> environment are flexibility, guaranteed availability of resources, strong
                        security and regulatory compliance and, in some cases, cost savings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many advantages of cloud computing are realized by the virtualization technology underlying all
                        types of cloud. Most servers are underutilized and virtualization provides private cloud users
                        with a better resource utilization experience, as workloads can be deployed on a different
                        physical server as resource demand changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One reason that makes this possible is the flexibility provided by virtualization, allowing
                        multiple applications and even operating systems to operate on the same physical machine. In
                        addition, if an application's resource requirements are changed, resources dedicated to the
                        specific virtual server running that application can be adjusted to meet them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This flexibility and improved resource utilization can help organizations to ensure application
                        performance, but also reduce costs by making the most of their servers. A private cloud
                        structure will not only save financial resources compared to a traditional on-premises
                        structure, for some companies it costs less than a public cloud environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Typically, low cost is considered one of the benefits, if not the main one, of public cloud
                        services and undoubtedly provides the greatest cost savings for some companies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Companies that migrate from an on-premises system generally tend to have an easier time with
                        their workloads in the private cloud because it is customizable to support any application. A
                        successful migration is essential to achieve the intended benefits of the new structure, that
                        the higher success rate of migrations to private clouds is another potential cause of a lower
                        total cost of ownership than the public cloud.

                    <h3>What decision to take?</h3>
                    <p>
                        When a company determines its needs and priorities in the cloud, it can decide whether the
                        private cloud will be a good choice for its IT structure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The private cloud must also be considered by companies that can benefit from the greater
                        flexibility of a virtual structure. Many companies, particularly between midsize and large
                        companies, run a variety of different applications, each residing on its own hardware. The
                        virtualization of a server that runs a certain software, allows the company to increase or
                        decrease the available resources. This provides performance improvements as servers running more
                        resource-intensive applications are provisioned with more computing power or memory. It also
                        offers cost savings as the increased resources are extracted from underutilized servers, rather
                        than rented or purchased separately.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To conclude whether a company will benefit from deploying a private cloud structure, the company
                        must assess its financial flexibility, security, compliance and resource requirements. You must
                        also consider the applications that will run and what environment is suitable for them, and your
                        own capabilities. A quality service provider offering hosted private cloud solutions can help
                        with these assessments and make company-specific recommendations.
