                    <h3>How does cloud computing work?</h3>
                    <p>Cloud computing uses a remote server to connect users' devices to centralized resources. A remote
                        server stores all the data and programs you need and can be in your own country or on the other
                        side
                        of the world, for example, in Japan.
                        The fact is that you can access them online, from anywhere, even if they are stored miles away.
                        There are 3 types of cloud computing: public, private and hybrid. If you have a business and
                        plan to
                        use a cloud service, keep in mind that the choice will depend on factors related to cost,
                        availability, performance and expectations.</p>

                    <h4>Cloud for personal use</h4>
                    <p>Regardless of the type of service, cloud computing services provide users with a number of
                        functions, including:</p>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li><span>Email services</span></li>
                        <li><span>Data storage, backup and recovery</span></li>
                        <li><span>Creating and testing applications</span></li>
                        <li><span>Analyzing data</span></li>
                        <li><span>Streaming audio and video</span></li>
                        <li><span>Providing software on demand</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Cloud computing is still a relatively new service, but it is being used by many different
                        organizations, from large corporations to small businesses, nonprofits to government agencies
                        and even individual consumers.</p>

                <article>
                    <h4>The business world</h4>
                    <p>Companies can employ cloud computing in different ways. Some users keep all applications and data
                        in the cloud, while others use a hybrid model, keeping certain applications and data on private
                        servers and others in the cloud.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the provision of services, the major players in the sphere of corporate computing
                        include:</p>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Cloud</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/pt-pt/" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://eu.alibabacloud.com/" target="_blank">Aliyun</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Amazon Web Services is 100% public and includes an outsourced model, depending on usage. Once on
                        the platform, you can sign up for additional applications and services. Microsoft Azure allows
                        customers to maintain some data on their own websites. Meanwhile, Aliyun is a subsidiary of the
                        Alibaba Group.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Now that you understand the concept of cloud computing, I recommend that before thinking
                        about the best
                        model for your business, reflect on the needs and priorities of your business, because it is
                        based on
                        them that you will decide which services are essential and who need this type of investment.
                    </p>
                    <p>Setting the available budget will also help you choose the best implementation system: SaaS,
                        PaaS or
                        IaaS.</p>
                    <p>Analyze the features and functionality you need and look for the providers that offer them,
                        for example,
                        encryption and other security methodologies, efficient backup services, 24-hour technical
                        assistance,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, it is always good to see the cloud, at first, as an environment for experimentation
                        and testing.
                    </p>
                    <p>There is a wide variety available on the market, analyze and carry out tests, observe how
                        your company
                        behaves when using this type of service and gradually implement cloud computing in your
                        processes.</p>
