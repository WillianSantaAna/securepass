                <p>
                    The <strong>Community Cloud</strong> is a digital experience platform and allows companies to
                    connect customers, partners and employees with each other and with the data and records needed to
                    get the job done.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Community Cloud allows you to streamline key business processes and extend them across offices and
                    departments, and outward to customers and partners. So everyone in your business ecosystem can
                    service customers more effectively, close deals faster, and get work done in real-time.

                        HR and IT Help Desk can engage employees and deliver critical knowledge and instructions. And
                        from onboarding to payroll to IT troubleshooting, employees can help themselves to the
