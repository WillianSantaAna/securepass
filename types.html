                <p>Based on a deployment model, we can classify cloud as:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><span>Public Cloud</span></li>
                    <li><span>Private Cloud</span></li>
                    <li><span>Hybrid Cloud</span></li>
                    <li><span>Community Cloud</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Based on a service the cloud model is offering, we are speaking of either:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><span>IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service)</span></li>
                    <li><span>PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)</span></li>
                    <li><span>SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)</span></li>
                    <li><span>or, Storage, Database, Information, Process, Application, Integration, Security,
                            Management,
                            Testing-as-a-service</span></li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Previously, we have explained how cloud works. Basically, programs that are needed to run a certain
                    application are now more popularly located on a remote machine, owned by another company. This is
                    done in order not to lose on the quality performance due to processing power of your own computer,
                    to save money on IT support, and yet remain advantageous on the market. These computers that run the
                    applications, store the data, and use a server system, are basically what we call "the cloud".

                    <h3>What Can I Do With It: Cloud Service</h3>
                    <p>
                        The most popular services of the cloud are that of either <strong>infrastructure</strong>,
                        <strong>platform</strong>, <strong>software</strong>, or <strong>storage</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As explained before, the most common cloud service is that one offering data storage disks and
                        virtual servers, i.e. infrastructure. Examples of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) companies
                        are Amazon, Rackspace, Flexiscale.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the cloud offers a development platform, and this includes operating system, programming
                        language execution environment, database, and web server, the model is known as
                        Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), examples of which are Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure,
                        Salesforce. Operating system can be frequently upgraded and developed with PaaS, services can be
                        obtained from diverse sources, and programming can be worked in teams (geographically
                        distributed).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), finally, means that users can access various software applications
                        on a pay-per-use basis. As opposed to buying licensed programs, often very expensive. Examples
                        of such services include widely used GMail, or Google Docs.

                    <h3>Private Cloud vs Public Cloud vs Hybrid Cloud</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are three general cloud models to choose from, each with a unique set of features and
                        benefits. A private cloud (also known as an internal cloud or corporate cloud) is the most secure
                        option because the company has direct control over the infrastructure and only authorized users can
                        access the network.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Public cloud services are another popular option because the company can control costs by reducing
                        hardware investments on site. With low initial costs, a company can easily deploy an application to
                        the public cloud. The public cloud also allows companies to fail with less loss if the application
                        does not meet expectations. This can be important for lean companies that need to set aside capital.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hybrid cloud models offer the advantages of public and private clouds by combining the two models
                        with a layer of proprietary software. The hybrid cloud makes it possible to store vital data in a
                        secure environment on-site, while leveraging the computing power of the public cloud. Meanwhile, the
                        company pays only for the computing power it uses, allowing for additional cost savings.
