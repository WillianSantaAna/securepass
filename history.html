                    <p>
                        In 1963, DARPA (Advanced Defense Research Projects Agency) submitted $ 2 million to MIT for the
                        MAC Project. The funding included a requirement by MIT to develop technology that would allow a
                        "computer to be used by two or more people simultaneously". In this case, one of those gigantic
                        and archaic computers using reels of magnetic tape for memory and was the precursor to what has
                        now become known collectively as Cloud Computing. It acted like a primitive cloud, with two or
                        three people accessing it. The word "virtualization" was used to describe this situation,
                        although the meaning of the word expanded later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1969, JCR Licklider helped develop ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network), a
                        "very" early version of the Internet. The JCR, or "Lick", was a psychologist and computer
                        scientist and promoted a vision called "Intergalactic Computer Network", in which everyone on
                        the planet would be interconnected through computers and able to access information from
                        anywhere. (How would a fantasy that is so unrealistic and impossible to pay for the future be?)
                        The Intergalactic Computer Network, also known as the Internet, is necessary for access to the
                        Cloud.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The meaning of virtualization began to change in the 1970s and now describes the creation of a
                        virtual machine, which acts like a real computer, with a fully functional operating system. The
                        concept of virtualization evolved with the Internet, when companies started offering "virtual"
                        private networks as a rentable service. The use of virtual computers became popular in the
                        1990s, leading to the development of modern Cloud Computing infrastructure.

                    <h3>The late 1990s</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the early stages, the cloud was used to express the empty space between the end user and the
                        provider.
                        In 1997, Professor Ramnath Chellapa of Emory University defined cloud computing as the new
                        "paradigm of computing, where the limits of computing will be determined by economic logic,
                        not just technical limits". This somewhat ponderous description sounds true when describing the
                        evolution
                        of the cloud.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The cloud gained popularity as companies gained a better understanding of their services and
                        usefulness.
                        In 1999, Salesforce became a popular example of successful use of Cloud Computing.
                        They used it as a pioneer in the idea of using the Internet to provide software programs to end
                        users.
                        The program (or application) can be accessed and downloaded by anyone with Internet access.
                        Companies can purchase the software on demand and cost-effectively without leaving the office.

                        In 2002, Amazon launched its web-based retail services. It was the first major company to think
                        of using only 10% of its capacity (which was common at the time) as a problem to be solved.
                        The cloud computing infrastructure model gave them the flexibility to use the capacity of their
                        computers much more efficiently. Soon after, other large organizations followed his example.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2006, Amazon launched Amazon Web Services, which offers online services to other sites or
                        customers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the same year, Google launched Google Docs services. Google Docs was originally based on two
                        separate products,
                        Google Spreadsheets (an Internet-based program that allows users to develop, update and edit
                        spreadsheets, as well as share data online)
                        and Writely (which gives tenants the ability to save documents, edit documents, and transfer
                        them to
                        blogging systems).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2007, IBM, Google and several universities joined forces to develop a server farm for
                        research
                        projects that require fast processors and large data sets.

                        Universities immediately realized that computer experiments can be done faster and with less
                        money
                        if
                        IBM and Google support their research. Because much of the research was focused on the issues
                        IBM
                        and Google
                        were interested in, they also benefited from the agreement.
                        2007 was also the year Netflix launched its video streaming service, using the cloud,
                        and provided support for the practice of "compulsive watching."

                    <p>
                        In 2011, IBM introduced the IBM SmartCloud framework in support of Smarter Planet (a cultural
                        thinking project).
                        Apple then launched ICloud, which focuses on storing more personal information (photos, music,
                        videos, etc.).
                        In addition, during this year, Microsoft began advertising the cloud on television, raising
                        awareness of its ability to store photos or videos with easy access.

                        Oracle introduced Oracle Cloud in 2012, offering the three basic principles for business,
                        Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service
                        (SAAS).

                    <h3>Nowadays</h3>
                    <p>
                        Today, companies can develop a private cloud system designed for their needs. These private
                        clouds store and can share sensitive data. The team can also use public clouds or a combination
                        of the two, called hybrid cloud. Much of the modern consumer business market relies on cloud
                        services.
                        Today, private cloud computing is used for email, to sign into online gaming platforms, and to
                        Facebook.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These private clouds are basically data centers, using many of the basic cloud technologies.
                        Private
                        clouds
                        offer all the advantages of a public cloud, but have the advantage of controlling security and
                        privacy
                        concerns.
                        The situation, however, leads to a bit of a dilemma.

                        Over time, public cloud computing companies, which are intensely competitive, will expand their
                        scalability and lower prices. Many private cloud owners will probably not be able to keep up,
                        having invested a small fortune in their own system. You must also add to the amazon web
                        services "cloud outage" equation, making customer sites inaccessible or difficult to work for
                        several hours. It should also be understood that a private cloud can experience the same type of
                        problem, possibly with a longer outage.
