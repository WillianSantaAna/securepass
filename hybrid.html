                <p>
                    <strong>Hybrid cloud</strong> is a computing environment that combines a public cloud and a private cloud 
                    by allowing data and applications to be shared between them. When computing and processing 
                    demand fluctuates, hybrid cloud computing gives businesses the ability to seamlessly scale 
                    their on-premises infrastructure up to the public cloud to handle any overflow—without giving 
                    third-party datacenters access to the entirety of their data. Organizations gain the flexibility 
                    and computing power of the public cloud for basic and non-sensitive computing tasks, while 
                    keeping business-critical applications and data on-premises, safely behind a company firewall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using a hybrid cloud not only allows companies to scale computing resources, it also eliminates 
                    the need to make massive capital expenditures to handle short-term spikes in demand as well as 
                    when the business needs to free up local resources for more sensitive data or applications. 
                    Companies will pay only for resources they temporarily use instead of having to purchase, 
                    program, and maintain additional resources and equipment that could remain idle over long periods 
                    of time. Hybrid cloud computing is a “best of all possible worlds” platform, delivering all the 
                    benefits of cloud computing—flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiencies—with the lowest 
                    possible risk of data exposure.

                    <h3>Are hybrid clouds secure?</h3>
                    <p>
                        A properly designed, integrated, and managed hybrid cloud can be as secure as traditional 
                        on-premise IT infrastructure. While there are some unique hybrid cloud security challenges 
                        (like data migration, increased complexity, and a larger attack surface), the presence of 
                        multiple environments can be one of the strongest defenses against security risks. All those 
                        interconnected environments let enterprises choose where to place sensitive data based on 
                        requirements, and it lets security teams standardize redundant cloud storage that can 
                        augment disaster recovery efforts.

                    <h3>Benefits of hybrid cloud</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Flexibility:</strong> Businesses that regularly experience spikes 
                        in demand might implement a hybrid cloud solution so that they can use a 
                        private cloud to run most of the workloads and access the public cloud only when usage spikes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Structure and separation:</strong> Hybrid cloud also offers an 
                        alternative for storing sensitive data—a company might provide services via a 
                        public cloud while keeping sensitive information safe on a private cloud.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While a private cloud is less expensive than using a public cloud 
                        (after an initial investment in the infrastructure), it does not easily scale. 
                        Growing the infrastructure requires the purchase of additional equipment. 
                        If usage of the private cloud shrinks, that expensive equipment sits unused.
